## 📝 Step-by-Step GitHub Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Repository name**: `kaizen-systems`
   - **Description**: `kAIzen Systems - Standardizing AI Workflows at Scale`
   - **Public** (select this)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

GitHub will show you the "Quick setup" page.

---

### Step 2: Link Your Local Repo to GitHub (1 minute)

Copy the repository URL from GitHub (should be):
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kaizen-systems.git
```

Then run this command in the terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kaizen-systems.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

---

### Step 3: Push Your Code (1 minute)

Run these commands:

```bash
# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

You'll see the upload progress. When it finishes, your code is on GitHub! 🎉

---

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
5. Click **"Save"**

GitHub will build your site (takes 1-2 minutes).

Your site will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/kaizen-systems/
```

## 🎯 Quick Command Reference

**If you need to update your site later:**

```bash
# Make changes to files
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push

# GitHub Pages auto-deploys within 1-2 minutes
```

## ✨ What Happens Next

Once GitHub Pages is enabled:

2. Site goes live at your GitHub Pages URL
3. SSL certificate auto-generated (HTTPS)
4. Updates automatically when you push changes

---

## 🔗 Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

If you own `kaizen.systems`:

1. In GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `kaizen.systems`
3. Click Save
4. In your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy):
   - Add A records pointing to GitHub's IPs:
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153`
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`
   - Add CNAME record: `www` → `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)
6. Site will be live at `kaizen.systems` and `www.kaizen.systems`
