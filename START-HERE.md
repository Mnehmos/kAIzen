## 🚀 Deploy in 4 Simple Steps

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Open a new browser tab: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `kaizen-systems`
   - **Description**: `kAIzen Systems - Standardizing AI Workflows at Scale`
   - **Visibility**: Select **Public**
   - **Do NOT check** "Initialize this repository with a README"
3. Click **"Create repository"**

Keep this tab open - you'll need it for Step 4.

### STEP 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (3 minutes)

Open a terminal in the `website` folder and run these commands **one at a time**:

**Command 1: Add GitHub as remote**
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kaizen-systems.git
```
*(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!)*

**Command 2: Rename branch to main**
```powershell
git branch -M main
```

**Command 3: Push to GitHub**
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

You'll see the upload progress. When it completes, refresh your GitHub repository page - your code is now live on GitHub! 🎉

---

### STEP 3: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

1. In your GitHub repository, click **"Settings"** (top navigation)
2. In left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**
3. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - **Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - **Branch**: Select **"main"**
   - **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**
4. Click **"Save"**

GitHub will start building your site. You'll see: **"Your site is being built from the main branch"**

Wait 1-2 minutes, then refresh the page. You'll see:
✅ **"Your site is live at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/kaizen-systems/"**

### STEP 4: Set Up Supabase Database (5 minutes)

Your website is live, but needs the database to function. Let's set it up:

**4.1 Open Supabase SQL Editor**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gotgnbwiodwkrsdmighy
2. Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar (icon looks like </> )

2. Open file: `supabase/schema.sql` in VS Code
3. Select ALL content (Ctrl+A)
4. Copy (Ctrl+C)
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** button (or Ctrl+Enter)
7. Wait for ✅ **"Success. No rows returned"** message

**4.3 Run Security Policies**
1. Click **"+ New query"** again
2. Open file: `supabase/rls-policies.sql`
3. Copy ALL content
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**
6. Wait for ✅ Success messages

**4.4 Add Newsletter Content**
1. Click **"+ New query"** again
2. Open file: `supabase/seed-data.sql`
3. Copy ALL content
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**
6. You should see: ✅ **"3 rows inserted"** for each table

**4.5 Verify It Worked**
1. In Supabase left sidebar, click **"Table Editor"**
2. You should see 4 tables:
   - `subscribers` (empty - ready for signups!)
   - `newsletter_issues` (3 rows) ✅
   - `techniques` (3 rows) ✅
   - `page_views` (empty - ready for analytics!)

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Can't create GitHub repo?** The GitHub MCP had connection issues - manual creation is easier anyway
- **Git commands not working?** Make sure you're in the `website` folder
- **Supabase queries failing?** Double-check you're in the correct project (gotgnbwiodwkrsdmighy)
- **Site not loading?** Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages initial build

**Quick debugging:** Open browser console (F12) to see any JavaScript errors
